# Campus Quest – Python coding standards 

These are our team rules for writing Python code.  
They are here to make our mini-games clear and easy for everyone to read.

## 1. File header

At the top of your main file, include:
Mini-game name
Author: Your Name

## 2. Names

Use clear, meaningful names for variables and functions (for example: score, target_number, ask_question).

Use lowercase_with_underscores for variables and functions (for example: player_score, check_answer).

## 3. Layout

Use 4 spaces for each level of indentation.

Keep your indentation consistent (do not mix tabs and spaces).

Keep your code tidy and lined up so it’s easy to read.

## 4. Input and output

Use print() and input() with clear, user-friendly messages.

Make sure the text you show to the player is easy to understand.

## 5. Comments

Add short comments to explain any tricky or important parts of your code.

Do not comment every line – only where it helps someone understand your logic.
